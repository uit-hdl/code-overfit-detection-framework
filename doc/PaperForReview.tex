\section{Suggestion}
\label{sec:intro}
% Computational pathology is study of disease using methods such as artificial intelligence. For building models, there are three main hindrances: 1) lack of publicly available data, 2) large image-size and high number of details and 3) lack of ground truth data due to expert disagreeance. Consequently, developers have to compromise when building a model. To know if models are accurate enough, explainable AI can help. But, are the explanations good enough that a pathologist can trust a model used to evaluate patient diagnosis and/or prognosis? 

\cite{sslUMAP} uses self-supervised learning to learn morphological features of Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LSCC). In training they use public TCGA and CPTAC datasets of H\&E-stained biopsy slides. They observe from previous work that other training algorithms cluster together tiles from the same slides, creating a batch effect where the algorithm learns features that are more slide specific than feature specific. This indicates that the network might do poorly on generalized input. They visualize this using 2D UMAP, shown in~\cref{fig:umap}.

\begin{figure}

  \caption{Figure taken entirely from~\cite{sslUMAP}. Both pictures show a 2D UMAP projection of tile representations. On the left a training algorithm with randomly sampled tiles from slides, showing that features learned in the same slide cluster together. Using a different sampling algorithm, the picture on the right shows a more even distribution w.r.t slides}
  \label{fig:umap}
\end{figure}

\subsection{UMAP}
 The algorithm is founded on three assumptions about the data
 \begin{enumerate}
    The data is uniformly distributed on Riemannian manifold;
    The Riemannian metric is locally constant (or can be approximated as such);
    The manifold is locally connected.
 \end{enumerate}


I wish to evaluate~\cite{sslUMAP} and quantify the quality of \textit{the explanation} using metrics inspired by Quantus~\cite{hedstrom2022quantus}. This means 1) finding relevant qualitative metrics for the given batch effect plots and 2) testing how the metrics change with model, batch and image adjustments. In particular, I am curious how well the metrics show batch/clustering effects for few (1-3) slides. This can be a useful indication early during a training process.
