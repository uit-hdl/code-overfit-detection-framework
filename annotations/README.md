# Clinical annotations
## TCGA LUSC
Download "clinical" from https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-LUSC as a tsv file
If you add all those slides to the cart, you can then download a "sample sheet" in the "cart section" of TCGA.

... but a more up-to date clinical sheet is in https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29625055/

## CPTAC
Annotations: download "clinical", then "clinical.tsv": [https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/CPTAC-3](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/CPTAC-3)
