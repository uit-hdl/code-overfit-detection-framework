I had a UMAP figure, didn't include which slides I was assessing

my XAI didn't actually assess the explanation, I was just putting arbitrary metrics to assess a 2D representation. Might as well have been in multidimension. Ugh

I should have went with a simple model first and plottet all of its results, including the loss function. There I would have discovered that I ran out of computer memory, the cox-scores, etc. Would have simplified things

I had a great time in Febrary, except the last week. Worth it?
